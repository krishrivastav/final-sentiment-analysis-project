# MCA e-Consultation Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A full-stack, AI-powered application designed to analyze, categorize, and visualize public sentiment on legislative drafts issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). 

By leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP), this dashboard instantly transforms thousands of raw public comments into actionable insights, interactive charts, and concise summaries.

##  Features

- ** Advanced NLP Engine**: Uses Hugging Face Transformers (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) to accurately classify comment sentiments (Positive, Critical, Negative).
- ** Automated Summarization**: Employs an NLTK-based extraction algorithm to identify key themes and frequently discussed topics.
- ** Persistent Storage**: All processed feedback is securely stored in a local SQLite database using SQLAlchemy, ensuring lightning-fast retrievals without needing to re-analyze files.
- ** Premium UI/UX**: Built with React and Vite, featuring a responsive, modern aesthetic.
  - ** Dark Mode**: Seamlessly switch between light and dark themes.
  - ** Keyword Highlighting**: Instantly locate searched terms highlighted vividly within the comment text.
  - ** Interactive Visuals**: Click on any chart segment (via Recharts) to automatically filter the main dashboard view.
  - ** Export Capabilities**: Download the analyzed data as a CSV or generate a PDF report of the visual dashboard.
